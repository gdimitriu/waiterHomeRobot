# Utils to calibrate or operate platform

## ultralight_write_read

This use the arduino nano from the moving_engines_processor.

This is used to read the number of click for each encoder.

The wheel should be move manually.

## pcf8574_int_sensors

This use the arduino nano from the moving_engines_processor.

This is used to check if the sensors are functional.
